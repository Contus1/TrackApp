# Streak Calculation Fix - Installation Guide

## What Was Fixed

The streak calculation was incorrectly counting total activities instead of consecutive days. Now it properly calculates:

- **One activity per day = One flame** üèÜ
- **Streak breaks after 3 days of inactivity** ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **Consecutive days matter, not total activities**

## Installation Steps

### 1. Run the SQL Script

Execute the following SQL script in your Supabase SQL Editor:

```sql
-- Copy and paste the content from: proper-streak-calculation.sql
```

This script creates:
- `calculate_user_current_streak()` function - Calculates proper consecutive day streaks
- `user_current_streaks` view - Provides current streak data for all users
- `get_user_streak_stats()` function - Enhanced streak statistics
- Updates `friends_simple` view to use correct streak calculation

### 2. Verify Installation

After running the SQL script, test with these queries:

```sql
-- Check your current streak
SELECT * FROM user_current_streaks WHERE user_id = auth.uid();

-- Test the function directly
SELECT calculate_user_current_streak(auth.uid());

-- Check friends with correct streaks
SELECT * FROM friends_simple WHERE user_id = auth.uid();
```

### 3. Frontend Updates

The following components have been updated:

- **StreakDisplay.tsx**: Now shows streak rules and 3-day grace period info
- **Dashboard.tsx**: Uses proper streak calculation from `user_current_streaks`
- **streakService.ts**: Updated `getFriendsWithStreaks()` to use correct data

## How It Works Now

### Streak Calculation Logic

1. **Daily Streaks**: Each day with at least one activity counts as 1 streak day
2. **Multiple Activities**: 2, 3, or more activities on the same day still count as just 1 streak day
3. **Grace Period**: Up to 3 consecutive days without activity before streak breaks
4. **Reset**: After 3+ days of inactivity, streak resets to 0

### Examples

**Scenario 1 - Building Streak:**
- Day 1: 1 workout ‚Üí Streak = 1
- Day 2: 3 workouts ‚Üí Streak = 2 (not 4!)
- Day 3: 1 workout ‚Üí Streak = 3

**Scenario 2 - Grace Period:**
- Day 1: 1 workout ‚Üí Streak = 5
- Day 2: No workout ‚Üí Streak = 5 (grace period)
- Day 3: No workout ‚Üí Streak = 5 (grace period)
- Day 4: No workout ‚Üí Streak = 5 (last grace day)
- Day 5: No workout ‚Üí Streak = 0 (broken!)

**Scenario 3 - Maintenance:**
- Day 1: 1 workout ‚Üí Streak = 10
- Day 2: No workout ‚Üí Streak = 10
- Day 3: 1 workout ‚Üí Streak = 11 (continues!)

## Benefits

‚úÖ **Accurate Counting**: Streaks now represent actual consecutive training days
‚úÖ **Fair System**: Multiple workouts per day don't inflate streaks
‚úÖ **Grace Period**: 3-day buffer prevents accidental streak loss
‚úÖ **Clear Rules**: Users understand exactly how streaks work
‚úÖ **Friend Comparison**: Friends' streaks are now accurate too

## Testing

1. Add activities on consecutive days and verify streak increases by 1 per day
2. Skip 1-2 days and verify streak maintains
3. Skip 4+ days and verify streak resets to 0
4. Check friends' streaks show consecutive days, not total activities

The app now correctly calculates streaks as intended! üî•
